FUNCTIONS
#RANDOMRANGE()-this method always give a INTEGER between given lower limit and  upper limit to this method 
Eg:random.randomrange(20).it will return integers between 0 to 19 (by default except upper limit).

#RANDOM()-this generates floating point between 0 to 1(including 0 and excluding 1).
Eg:0.99,0.44.........

#RANDINT()-this will take two parameters a and b;it will give ANY INTEGER between limits including a and b.
Eg:random.randomint(2,8);ans=4,5,8,2...

#UNIFORM()-this method will give a FLOATING POINT NUMBER between two givin numbers.it will include lower limit and except upper limit.
Eg:random.uniform(2,6);ans=2,5,4....

#CHOICE()-thIs method is used for random selection from list and tuple or string.
Eg:lst=[2,4,5,6]
random.choice(lst);ans=4,5,2....
Eg:t=(4,6,8,9)
random.choice(t);ans=6,4,3...
Eg:random.choice("python");ans='p','o','n','y'......
#SUFFLE()-this method is used for suffle the items of the given list.
Eg:lst=[3,5,8,2,1];random.shuffle(lst);ans=[5,2,1,3,8]
